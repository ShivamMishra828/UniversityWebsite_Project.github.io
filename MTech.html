            MTech Thermal engineering is a sub-discipline of mechanical engineering concerned with the movement and transmission of heat energy. Energy can be converted into different types or moved across two mediums. 
            It entails the investigation of design systems that use thermodynamics to deliver heating or cooling by transferring heat or energy through liquids and gases. It aids in understanding how these systems are built and doing tests to verify appropriate functionality. Candidates enrolled in the programme receive training in design, development, and simulation, as well as the opportunity to explore new topics in Thermal Energy Systems and related sciences.
